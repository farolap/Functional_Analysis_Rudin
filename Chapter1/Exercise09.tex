Suppose
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $X$ and $Y$ are topological vector spaces,
    \item $\Lambda: X \to Y$ is linear,
    \item $N$ is a closed subspace of $X$,
    \item $\pi: X \to X/N$ is the quotient map, and
    \item $\Lambda x=0 \ \forall \ x \in N$
\end{enumerate}
Prove that there is a unique $f: X/N\to Y$ which satisfies $\Lambda=f\circ \pi$, that is, $\Lambda x=f(\pi(x))$ for all $x\in X$. Prove that this $f$ is linear and that $\Lambda$ is continuous iff $f$ is continuous. Also, $\Lambda$ is open iff $f$ is open.

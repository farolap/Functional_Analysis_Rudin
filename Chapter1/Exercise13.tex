Let $C$  be the vector space of all complex continuous functions on $[0,1]$. Define
$$
d(f,g)=\int_0^1\frac{|f(x)-g(x)|}{1+|f(x)-g(x)|}dx.
$$

Let $(C,\sigma)$ be $C$ with the topology induced by this metric. Let $(C,\tau)$ be the topological vector space defined by the seminorms

$$
p_x(f)=|f(x)| \quad (0\leq x \leq 1)
$$

in accordance with Theorem 1.37.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Prove that every $\tau$-bounded set in $C$ is also $\sigma$-bounded and that the identity map $id: (C,\tau) \to (C,\sigma)$ therefore carries bounded sets into bounded sets.
    \item Prove that $id: (C,\tau) \to (C,\sigma)$ is nevertheless not continuous, although it is sequentially continuous (by Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem). Hence $(C,\tau)$ is not metrizable. (See Appendix A6, or Theorem 1.132.) Show also directly that $(C,\tau)$ has no countable local base.

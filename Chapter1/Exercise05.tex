Consider the definition of bounded set given in Section 1.6. Would the content of this definition be altered if it were required merely that to every neighborhood $V$ of $0$ corresponds \textit{some} $t>0$ such that $E\subset tV$?

\begin{itemize}
    \item Yes. Let $E$ be a bounded set and $V$ a neighborhood of $0$. Then, let $s,t>0$ and $t>s$, such that $E\subset sV$, but not $E\subset tV$.
\end{itemize}


% E = \{x \in X : \|x\| \leq 1\}
% V = B_{\varepsilon}(0) = \{x \in X : \|x\| < \varepsilon\}
% s = 1
% t = 2
% E \subset sV \text{ but not } E \subset tV
% tV = \{x \in X : \|x\| < t\varepsilon\}
